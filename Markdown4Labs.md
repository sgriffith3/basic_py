# Title

### Lab Objective

A description of what is going to be accomplished or attempted in this lab.

This is a really good place for diagrams, pictures, and definitions.

### Procedure

0. Always number with a zero. This allows for auto numbering, so switching steps around isn't a headache.

0. Numbering will continue as long as everything stays lined up properly. That means that if we want lab steps to go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... and not 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1 ... then we have to care about our indentation levels.

    0. Everything that should live under a major lab step (like the prompt and command) needs to have one full line break before it. Otherwise, it will be counted as a part of the last paragraph.
    
    0. Also, These items need to be indented 4 spaces. Count them. <kbd>space</kbd> 1 <kbd>space</kbd> 2 <kbd>space</kbd> 3 <kbd>space</kbd> 4. 
    
    `[root@centos-000-centos1 ~]` `the correct general (000) prompt, followed by a <kbd>space</kbd> then the command`
    
    Put all of the prompt and all of the code in separate tick marks (<kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>~</kbd>).
    
0. Dedent to continue with the numbering properly.

    - A list should be indented under the appropriate step
    - It also needs to **NOT** have a line between the list items
    - We can also do a plain code block. This requires us to be indented 8 spaces from the start of the line we wish to have it under (bare minimum is 8 spaces, can do more if necessary)
    - Here we go:
    - <kbd>space</kbd> 1 <kbd>space</kbd> 2 <kbd>space</kbd> 3 <kbd>space</kbd> 4 <kbd>space</kbd> 1 <kbd>space</kbd> 2 <kbd>space</kbd> 3 <kbd>space</kbd> 4
        
            This is a code block now

            See how it keeps our line spacing
            even when it wraps?

            This is good
        
0. Yes, you can get fancier with markdown. Don't do that until you have mastered this.

  or else
  
0. Our numbering starts

   all over
   
0. again.

Don't do that.
